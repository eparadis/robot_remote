# we're only looking at two markers, though the image show four
# the ground marker is considered '0 0 0deg'
#  its in the center set and we're concerned with marker 290
#  that's the one on the left, way from the cardboard-colored corner
# the robot marker is the position we're trying to measure
#  is the one that moves around in the frame
#  the marker we are concerned with is 678
#  that's the one near the strip of uncovered cardboard
# for scale, the black border of the markers are 3.6 inches
# the wood flooring is 4.75"
# because the X and Y positions were guessed after the fact, the rotations
#  are probably the only really solid measurement here
